3,abstract test case,Note to entry: An abstract test case is a formal basis for deriving executable test cases One or more test purposes are encapsulated in the abstract test case. An abstract test case is independent of both the implementation and the values. It should be complete in the sense that it is sufficient to enable a test verdict to be assigned unambiguously to each potentially observable test outcome (i.e. sequence of test events).
5,abstract test module,Note to entry: Abstract test modules may be nested in a hierarchical way.
6,abstract test suite,Note to entry: Abstract test suites are described in a conformance clause.
7,acceptance testing (user),"Note 1 to entry: This includes the planning and execution of several kinds of tests (e.g. functional, volume, performance tests) that demonstrate that the implementation satisfies the user requirements."
7,acceptance testing (user),Note 2 to entry: This is not a part of conformance testing 
8,accuracy,A test result can be observations or measurements.
9,actor (UML),Note to entry: A test result can be observations or measurements.
11,aggregation (UML),Note to entry: See composition
12,altitude,Note 1 to entry: See ellipsoidal height and gravity-related height.
12,altitude,Note 2 to entry: Height of a point outside the surface treated as positive; negative height is designated as depth.
13,annotation,"Note to entry: Numbers, letters, symbols, and signs are examples of annotation"
17,association (UML);,Note to entry: A binary association is an association among exactly two classifiers (including the possibility of an association from a classifier to itself).
18,attitude,"Note to entry: In positioning services, this is usually the orientation of the user's platform, such as an aircraft, boat, or automobile."
19,attribute,"Note to entry: Describes a geometrical, topological, thematic, or other characteristic of an entity"
20,attribute (UML),"Note 1 to entry: An attribute is semantically equivalent to a composition association; however, the intent and usage is normally different."
20,attribute (UML),Note 2 to entry:-Feature- used in this definition is the UML meaning of the term and is not meant as defined in 4.1 of this Technical Specification. 
24,bag,"Note to entry: Logically, a bag is a set of pairs <item, count>."
29,boundary,"Note to entry: Boundary is most commonly used in the context of geometry, where the set is a collection of points or a collection of objects that represent those points. In other arenas, the term is used metaphorically to describe the transition between an entity and the rest of its domain of discourse."
34,candidate route,Navigation is the process of finding the candidate route that optimizes a chosen cost function.
36,cardinality (UML),Note to entry: Contrast: multiplicity.
37,Cartesian coordinate system,Note to entry: n is 2 or 3 for the purposes of this International Standard.
43,class (UML),Note to entry: A class may use a set of interfaces to specify collections of operations it provides to its environment. See: interface.
44,classifier (UML),"Note to entry: Classifiers include interfaces, classes, datatypes, and components."
48,coboundary,"Note to entry: If a node is on the boundary of an edge, that edge is on the coboundary of that node. Any orientation parameter associated to one of these relations would also be associated to the other. So that if the node is the end node of the edge (defined as the end of the positive directed edge), then the positive orientation of the node (defined as the positive directed node) would have the edge on its coboundary, see ISO 19107 Figure 35."
55,composite curve,"A composite curve, as a set of direct positions, has all the properties of a curve."
56,composite solid,"A composite solid, as a set of direct positions, has all the properties of a solid."
57,composite surface,"A composite surface, as a set of direct positions, has all the properties of surface."
64,concept,"Concepts are not necessarily bound to particular languages. They are, however, influenced by the social or cultural background which often leads to different categorizations."
67,conceptual formalism,One conceptual formalism can be expressed in several conceptual schema languages.
70,conceptual schema language,Note to entry: A conceptual schema language may be lexical or graphical. Several conceptual schema languages can be based on the same conceptual formalism.
