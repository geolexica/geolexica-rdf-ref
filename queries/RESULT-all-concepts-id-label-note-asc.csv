3,abstract test case,Note to entry: An abstract test case is a formal basis for deriving executable test cases One or more test purposes are encapsulated in the abstract test case. An abstract test case is independent of both the implementation and the values. It should be complete in the sense that it is sufficient to enable a test verdict to be assigned unambiguously to each potentially observable test outcome (i.e. sequence of test events).
5,abstract test module,Note to entry: Abstract test modules may be nested in a hierarchical way.
6,abstract test suite,Note to entry: Abstract test suites are described in a conformance clause.

17,association (UML);,Note to entry: A binary association is an association among exactly two classifiers (including the possibility of an association from a classifier to itself).
18,attitude,"Note to entry: In positioning services, this is usually the orientation of the user's platform, such as an aircraft, boat, or automobile."
19,attribute,"Note to entry: Describes a geometrical, topological, thematic, or other characteristic of an entity"
20,attribute (UML),"Note 1 to entry: An attribute is semantically equivalent to a composition association; however, the intent and usage is normally different."

24,bag,"Note to entry: Logically, a bag is a set of pairs <item, count>."
29,boundary,"Note to entry: Boundary is most commonly used in the context of geometry, where the set is a collection of points or a collection of objects that represent those points. In other arenas, the term is used metaphorically to describe the transition between an entity and the rest of its domain of discourse."
34,candidate route,Navigation is the process of finding the candidate route that optimizes a chosen cost function.
36,cardinality (UML),Note to entry: Contrast: multiplicity.
37,Cartesian coordinate system,Note to entry: n is 2 or 3 for the purposes of this International Standard.

44,classifier (UML),"Note to entry: Classifiers include interfaces, classes, datatypes, and components."
48,coboundary,"Note to entry: If a node is on the boundary of an edge, that edge is on the coboundary of that node. Any orientation parameter associated to one of these relations would also be associated to the other. So that if the node is the end node of the edge (defined as the end of the positive directed edge), then the positive orientation of the node (defined as the positive directed node) would have the edge on its coboundary, see ISO 19107 Figure 35."
55,composite curve,"A composite curve, as a set of direct positions, has all the properties of a curve."

57,composite surface,"A composite surface, as a set of direct positions, has all the properties of surface."
64,concept,"Concepts are not necessarily bound to particular languages. They are, however, influenced by the social or cultural background which often leads to different categorizations."
67,conceptual formalism,One conceptual formalism can be expressed in several conceptual schema languages.
70,conceptual schema language,Note to entry: A conceptual schema language may be lexical or graphical. Several conceptual schema languages can be based on the same conceptual formalism.
78,connected,Note to entry: A topological object is connected if and only if all its geometric realizations are connected. This is not included as a definition because it follows from a theorem of topology.
81,constraint (UML),"Note to entry: Certain constraints are predefined in the UML, others may be user defined. Constraints are one of three extensibility mechanisms in UML. See: tagged value, stereotype."
82,content model,"Note to entry: The term ""information view"" comes from the ISO Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) as specified in 19101-2."
83,continuous coverage,"Note to entry: Although the domain of a continuous coverage is ordinarily bounded in terms of its spatial and/or temporal extent, it can be subdivided into an infinite number of direct positions."
86,convex hull,"""Smallest"" is the set theoretic smallest, not an indication of a measurement. The definition can be rewritten as ""the intersection of all convex sets that contain the geometric object"". Another definition in a Euclidean space bbb""E""^n is the union of all lines with both end points in the given geometric object."
86,convex hull,"C = A.""convexHull"" <=> [C.""convex"" = ""TRUE""] ^^ [A sub C] ^^ [[B.""convex"" = ""true"", A sub B] => [A sube C sube B]]"
87,convex set,"Note to entry: Convex sets are ""simply connected"", meaning that they have no interior holes, and can normally be considered topologically isomorphic to a Euclidean ball of the appropriate dimension. So the surface of a sphere can be considered to be geodesically convex."
88,coordinate,"Note to entry: In a coordinate reference system, the coordinate numbers are qualified by units."
91,coordinate operation,Note to entry: Supertype of coordinate transformation and coordinate conversion.
97,cost function,"Note to entry: The normal mechanism is to apply a cost to each part of a route, and to define the total route cost as the sum of the cost of the parts. This is necessary for the operation of the most common navigation algorithms. The units of cost functions are not limited to monetary costs and values only, but include such measures as time, distance, and possibly others. The only requirement is that the function be additive and at least non-negative. This last criteria can be softened as long as no zero or less cost is associated with any loop in the network, as this will prevent the existence of a ""minimal cost"" route. "
99,coverage,"Note to entry: In other words, a coverage is a feature that has multiple values for each attribute type, where each direct position within the geometric representation of the feature has a single value for each attribute type."
101,curve,"Note to entry: The boundary of a curve is the set of points at either end of the curve. If the curve is a cycle, the two ends are identical, and the curve (if topologically closed) is considered to not have a boundary. The first point is called the start point, and the last is the end point. Connectivity of the curve is guaranteed by the ""continuous image of a line"" clause. A topological theorem states that a continuous image of a connected set is connected."
102,curve segment,Note to entry: The geometric set represented by a single curve segment is equivalent to a curve.
103,cycle (geometry),"Note to entry: Cycles are used to describe boundary components (see shell, ring). A cycle has no boundary because it closes on itself, but it is bounded (i.e., it does not have infinite extent). A circle or a sphere, for example, has no boundary, but is bounded."
111,data product specification,"Note to entry: A data product specification provides a description of the universe of discourse and a specification for mapping the universe of discourse to a dataset. It may be used for production, sales, end-use or other purposes."
113,data quality element,Note to entry: The applicability of a data quality element to a dataset depends on both the dataset's content and its product specification; the result being that all data elements may not be applicable to all datasets.
116,data quality overview element,"Note to entry: Information about the purpose, usage, and lineage of a dataset is non-quantitative information."
118,data quality scope,"Note to entry: A data quality scope for a dataset can comprise a dataset series to which the dataset belongs, the dataset itself, or a smaller grouping of data located physically within the dataset sharing common characteristics. Common characteristics can be an identified feature type, feature attribute, or feature relationship; data collection criteria; original source; or a specified geographic or temporal extent."
120,data quality value type,Note to entry: A data quality value type is always provided for a data quality result.
291,metadata entity, Note 1 to entry: May contain one or more metadata entities.
291,metadata entity,Note 2 to entry: Equivalent to a class in UML terminology.
292,metadata schema,Note to entry: ISO 19115 describes a standard for a metadata schema.

295,method (UML),Note to entry: It specifies the algorithm or procedure associated with an operation.
300,month,Note to entry: The duration of a month is an integer number of days. The number of days in a month is determined by the rules of the particular calendar.
304,multiplicity (UML),"Note to entry: Multiplicity specifications may be given for roles within associations, parts within composites, repetitions and other purposes. Essentially a multiplicity is a (possibly infinite) subset of the non-negative integers. Contrast: cardinality."
306,navigation,"Note to entry: This is essentially the common term navigation, but the definition decomposes the process in terms used in the packages defined in this International Standard."
308,network,"Note to entry: The network is essentially the universe of discourse for the navigation problem. Networks are a variety of 1-dimensional topological complex. In this light, junction and topological node are synonyms, as are link and directed edge."
309,node,Note to entry: The boundary of a node is the empty set.
312,object,"Note to entry: This term was first used in this way in the general theory of object oriented programming, and later adopted for use in this same sense in UML. An object is an instance of a class. Attributes and relationships represent state. Operations, methods, and state machines represent behavior."
313,object (UML),"Note to entry: State is represented by attributes and relationships, behaviour is represented by operations, methods, and state machines. An object is an instance of a class. See: class, instance."
317,operating conditions,"Note to entry: Measurements acquired in the field are affected by many instrumental and environmental factors, including meteorological conditions, computational methods and constraints, imperfect instrument construction, incomplete instrument adjustment or calibration, and, in the case of optical measuring systems, the personal bias of the observer. Solutions for positions may be affected by the geometric relationships of the observed data and/or mathematical model employed in the processing software."
318,operation,Note 1 to entry: An operation has a name and a list of parameters.
318,operation,Note 2 to entry: See 7.2 [of ISO 19119] for a discussion of operation
319,operation (UML),"Note 1 to entry: An operation has a signature, which may restrict the actual parameters that are possible."
319,operation (UML),Note 2 to entry: Definition from UML Reference Manual: A specification of a transformation or query that an object may be called to execute.
319,operation (UML),Note 3 to entry: An operation has a name and a list of parameters. A method is a procedure that implements an operation. It has an algorithm or procedure description.
325,package (UML),Note to entry: Packages may be nested within other packages. Both model elements and diagrams may appear in a package.
328,performance indicator,"Note to entry: Performance indicators can be used as quality-control evidence of the positioning system and/or positioning solution. Internal quality control may include such factors as signal strength of received radio signals [signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)], figures indicating the dilution of precision (DOP) due to geometric constraints in radiolocation systems, and system-specific figure of merit (FOM)."
329,performance testing,Note to entry: This is not a part of conformance testing
330,period,Note to entry: A period is bounded by two different temporal positions.
333,physical quantity,Note to entry: In GML a physical quantity is always a value described using a numeric amount with a scale or using a scalar reference system. Physical quantity is a synonym for measure when the latter is used as a noun.
336,point,Note to entry: The boundary of a point is the empty set.
347,position,"Note to entry: A direct position is a semantic subtype of position. Direct positions as described can only define a point and therefore not all positions can be represented by a direct position. That is consistent with the ""is type of"" relation. An 19107 geometry is also a position, just not a direct position."
348,positional accuracy,"Note to entry: The phrase ""absolute accuracy"" is sometimes used for this concept to distinguish it from relative positional accuracy. Where the true coordinate value may not be perfectly known, accuracy is normally tested by comparison to available values that can best be accepted as true."
349,positional system,"Note to entry: Examples include inertial, integrated, linear, optical, and satellite positioning systems."
350,precision,Note to entry: Precision is usually expressed as a statistical value based upon a set of repeated measurements such as the standard deviation from the sample mean.
356,profile,"Note to entry: A profile is derived from base standards so that by definition, conformance to a profile is conformance to the base standards from which it is derived."
364,raster,Note to entry: A raster is a type of grid.
366,record,"Note to entry: Logically, a record is a set of pairs <name, item >."
367,rectified grid,"Note to entry: If the coordinate reference system is related to the earth by a datum, the grid is a georectified grid."
369,referenceable grid,"Note to entry: If the coordinate reference system is related to the earth by a datum, the grid is a georeferenceable grid."
370,refinement (UML),"Note to entry: For example, a design class is a refinement of an analysis class"
376,relationship (UML),"Note to entry: Kinds of relationships include association, generalization, metarelationship, flow and several kinds grouped under dependency."
377,relative position,"Note to entry: The spatial relationship of one point relative to another may be one-, two- or three-dimensional."
378,relative positional accuracy,"Note to entry: Closely related terms such as local accuracy are employed in various countries, agencies and application groups. Where such terms are utilized, it is necessary to provide a description of the term."
385,ring,Note to entry: Rings are used to describe boundary components of surfaces in 2D and 3D coordinate systems.
386,robustness testing,Note to entry: This is not a part of conformance testing
387,route,Note to entry: This is not a part of conformance testing
389,route instruction,"Note to entry: To minimize the number of instructions needed to complete a route traversal, a default instruction can be assumed at junctions without specifically associated instructions. This default is called the main-road rule."
392,satellite positioning system,"Note to entry: In this context, satellite positioning implies the use of radio signals transmitted from ""active"" artificial objects orbiting the Earth and received by ""passive"" instruments on or near the Earth's surface to determine position, velocity, and/or attitude of an object. Examples are GPS and GLONASS."
403,sequence,"Note to entry: Logically, a sequence is a set of pairs <item, offset>. LISP syntax, which delimits sequences with parentheses and separates elements in the sequence with commas, is used in this International Standard."
405,service,Note to entry: See 7.2 [of ISO 19119] for a discussion of service
410,shell,Note to entry: Shells are used to describe boundary components of solids in 3D coordinate systems.
411,simple,Note to entry: This implies that no interior direct position is involved in a self-intersection of any kind.
416,solid,"Note to entry: A solid is realizable locally as a three parameter set of direct positions. The boundary of a solid is the set of oriented, closed surfaces that comprise the limits of the solid."
420,spatial operator,Note to entry: Any UML operation on a spatial object would be classified as a spatial operator as are the query operators in clause 8 of IS 19107.
421,spatial reference,"Note to entry: This may take the form of a label, code or coordinate tuple."
423,spatiotemporal domain <coverage>,Note to entry: The spatiotemporal domain of a continuous coverage consists of a set of direct positions defined in relation to a collection of spatiotemporal objects.
425,specification (UML),Note to entry: Contrast: implementation.
432,stereotype (UML),"Note to entry: Stereotypes must be based on certain existing types or classes in the metamodel. Stereotypes may extend the semantics, but not the structure of pre-existing types and classes. Certain stereotypes are predefined in the UML, others may be user defined. Stereotypes are one of three extensibility mechanisms in UML. The others are constraint and tagged value."
433,strong substitutability,Note to entry: The weaker forms of substitutability make various restrictions on the context of the implied substitution.
434,subcomplex,"Note to entry: Since the definitions of geometric complex and topological complex require only that they be closed under boundary operations, the set of any primitives of a particular dimension and below is always a subcomplex of the original, larger complex. Thus, any full planar topological complex contains an edge-node graph as a subcomplex."
437,surface,"Note to entry: The boundary of a surface is the set of oriented, closed curves that delineate the limits of the surface. Surfaces that are isomorphic to a sphere, or to an n-torus (a topological sphere with n ""handles"") have no boundary. Such surfaces are called cycles."
441,tag (XML),"Note to entry: A tag with no forward slash (e.g. <Road> ) is called a start-tag (also opening tag), and one with a forward slash (e.g. </Road> is called an end-tag (also closing tag)."
442,tagged value (XML),"Note to entry: In a tagged value, the name is referred as the tag. Certain tags are predefined in the UML; others may be user defined. Tagged values are one of three extensibility mechanisms in UML. The others are constraint and stereotype."
451,term,"Note to entry: A term may contain symbols and can have variants, e.g. different forms of spelling."
452,term equivalent,Note to entry: A term equivalent should be accompanied by a definition of the designated concept expressed in the same language as the term equivalent
457,tessellation,"Note to entry: A tessellation composed of congruent regular polygons or polyhedra is a regular tessellation. One composed of regular, but non-congruent polygons or polyhedra is a semi-regular tessellation. Otherwise the tessellation is irregular."
461,topological boundary,Note to entry: The boundary of a topological complex corresponds to the boundary of the geometric realization of the topological complex.
462,topological complex,"Note to entry: Closed under the boundary operations means that if a topological primitive is in the topological complex, then its boundary objects are also in the topological complex."
463,topological dimension,"Note to entry: The free variables mentioned above can usually be thought of as a local coordinate system. In a 3D coordinate space, a plane can be written as P(u, v) = A + u X + v Y, where u and v are real numbers and A is any point on the plane, and X and Y are two vectors tangent to the plane. Since the locations on the plane can be distinguished by u and v (here universally), the plane is 2D and (u, v) is a coordinate system for the points on the plane. On generic surfaces, this cannot, in general, be done universally. If we take a plane tangent to the surface, and project points on the surface onto this plane, we will normally get a local isomorphism for small neighbourhoods of the point of tangency. This ""local coordinate"" system for the underlying surface is sufficient to establish the surface as a 2D topological object. Since this International Standard deals only with spatial coordinates, any 3D object can rely on coordinates to establish its topological dimension. In a 4D model (spatio-temporal), tangent spaces also play an important role in establishing topological dimension for objects up to 3D. "
465,topological expression,Note to entry: Topological expressions are used for many calculations in computational topology.
466,topological object,"Note to entry: A topological object is a topological primitive, a collection of topological primitives, or a topological complex."
467,topological primitive,Note to entry: A topological primitive corresponds to the interior of a geometric primitive of the same dimension in a geometric realization.
468,topological solid,Note to entry: The boundary of a topological solid consists of a set of directed faces.
474,traversable,"Note to entry: Traversability is usually a function of physical, cultural, or legal conditions. If traversable is false, then the object cannot be navigated. This effectively removes a link from the usable network. In the case of a node, it effectively removes the node and all associated links from the useable network. In the case of a turn, it simply removes it from any viable route. Non-traversable entities are not included in maneuvers or routes."
477,tuple,Note to entry: The number of values in a tuple is immutable
480,uncertainty,"Note to entry: When the quality of accuracy or precision of measured values, such as coordinates, is to be characterized quantitatively, the quality parameter is an estimate of the uncertainty of the measurement results. Because accuracy is a qualitative concept, one should not use it quantitatively, that is associate numbers with it; numbers should be associated with measures of uncertainty instead."
481,Uniform Resource Identifier,Note to entry: The general syntax is <scheme>::<scheme-specific-part>. The hierarchical syntax with a namespace is <scheme>://<authority><path>?<query> - see RFC 2396.
483,unit of measure,"Note to entry: In positioning services, the usual units of measurement are either angular units or linear units. Implementations of positioning services must clearly distinguish between SI units and non-SI units. When non-SI units are employed, it is requird that their relation to SI units be specified."
484,universal face,"Note to entry: The universal face is normally not part of any feature, and is used to represent the unbounded portion of the data set. Its interior boundary (it has no exterior boundary) would normally be considered the exterior boundary of the map represented by the data set. This International Standard does not special case the universal face, but application schemas may find it convenient to do so."
485,universal solid,"Note to entry: The universal solid is the 3-dimensional counterpart of the universal face, and is also normally not part of any feature."
489,value (UML),Note 1 to entry: A value may consider a possible state of an object within a class or type (domain).
489,value (UML),"Note 2 to entry: A data value is an instance of a data type, a value without identity"
491,vector,Note to entry: A directed line segment represents a vector if the length and direction of the line segment are equal to the magnitude and direction of the vector. The term vector data refers to data that represents the spatial configuration of features as a set of directed line segments.
493,vehicle classification,"Note to entry: Classifications based on construction include automobile, truck, bus, bicycle, etc. Classifications based on purpose include taxi, emergency vehicle, etc. Vehicle classification can be used to determine the application of navigation constraints."
501,local datum,Note to entry: Engineering datum excludes both geodetic and vertical datums. 
506,clarification,Note to entry: A non-substantive change does not change the semantics or technical meaning of the item. Clarification does not result in a change to the registration status of the register item.
508,register manager,"Note to entry: In the case of an ISO register, the register manager performs the functions of the registration authority specified in the ISO/IEC Directives."
509,retirement,Note to entry: The status of the retired item changes from 'valid' to 'retired'. A retired item is kept in the register to support the interpretation of data produced before its retirement.
510,supersession,"Note to entry: The status of the replaced item changes from ""valid"" to ""superseded."""
518,object point,Note to entry: In remote sensing and aerial photogrammetry an object point is a point defined in an Earth-fixed coordinate reference system.
532,attribute (XML),"Note to entry: In this document an attribute is an XML attribute unless otherwise specified. The syntax of an XML attribute is ""Attribute::= Name = AttValue"". An attribute typically acts as an XML element modifier (e.g. <Road gml:id = ""r1"" />; here gml:id is an attribute."
534,property (GML),"Note to entry: It corresponds to feature attribute and feature association role in ISO 19109. If a GML property of a feature has an xlink:href attribute that references a feature, the property represents a feature association role."
551,image,Note to entry: The physical parameters are the result of measurement by a sensor or a prediction from a model
558,knowledge base,"Note to entry: The data base contains facts, inferences, and procedures needed for problem solution [Webster Computer]"
605,depth,Note to entry: A depth above the reference surface will have a negative value
614,height,Note to entry: A height below the reference surface will have a negative value.
619,pixel,"Note 1 to entry: This term originated as a contraction of ""picture element"""
619,pixel,Note 2 to entry: Related to the concept of a grid cell
620,polar coordinate system,"Note to entry: For the three-dimensional case, see spherical coordinate system (4.44)."
622,semi-major axis,Note to entry: This equates to the semi-diameter of the ellipsoid measured in its equatorial plane.
623,semi-minor axis,Note to entry: The shortest axis coincides with the rotation axis of the ellipsoid and therefore contains both poles. 
627,unit,"Note to entry: In this International Standard, the subtypes of units are length units, angular units, time units, scale units and pixel spacing units."
629,vertical datum,"Note to entry: In most cases, the vertical datum will be related to mean sea level. Ellipsoidal heights are treated as related to a three-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinate system referenced to a geodetic datum. Vertical datums include sounding datums (used for hydrographic purposes), in which case the heights may be negative heights or depths. "
632,data quality basic measure,Note to entry: Data quality basic measures are abstract data types. They cannot be used directly when reporting data quality.
639,resolution (of a sensor),"Note to entry: For imagery, resolution refers to radiometric, spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions."
640,scene,Note to entry: A scene may correspond to a remotely sensed view of the natural world or to a computer-generated virtual scene simulating such a view
645,prism (one parameter set of geometries),Note to entry: This is a generalization of the concept of a geometric prism that is the convex hull of two congruent polygons in 3D-space. Such polyhedrons can be viewed as a foliation of congruent polygons.
646,trajectory,Note to entry: This is a generalization of the concept of a geometric prism that is the convex hull of two congruent polygons in 3D-space. Such polyhedrons can be viewed as a foliation of congruent polygons.
656,active object,"Note to entry: cf. passive object. An active object can represent a user, or an active service that depends on internal (and therefore not visible) triggers to start actions. Active and passive states can exist for the same object, and such a service can transition between these two states depending on invocation of an activation or deactivation operation protocol."
658,basic service,"Note to entry: cf. interoperate. Basic services lack any persistent, user-specific state information between invocations and are not meant for direct access by users. Because they act in a functional manner, they are readily replaceable at runtime by other services using the same interfaces."
659,continuous change,"Note to entry: The interpolation of continuous change is usually done by taking into consideration constraints on the ""curve"" joining the two data points (time1, value1) and (time2, value2), looking at the value as a function of time. For example, if the continuous change is for the motion of a vehicle, then the constraints of physics and of the paths appropriate for that vehicle must be taken into consideration."
660,coupling,"Note 1 to entry: Compare with integration. While the conceptual schema of the information transferred shall be agreed upon to some level, coupling applications can be and are usually flexible in the data representation of that information as long as the semantics content is correct and mappable to some canonical representation of the conceptual schema. The most common mapping technology used for XML messages is XSLT, and the transformation stylesheet can be supplied either by the service broker or by the service provider. It is considered a best practice for a service provider to supply his functionality through several logically equivalent messaging APIs, each represented by a different URI linked to an XSLT transformation bridge, and implemented by the same internal code."
662,discrete change,"Note to entry: Legal changes of parcel changes are discrete, having occurred at a specific time."
663,discrete spatiotemporal object,Note to entry: See Theodoridis - 1999
664,distance measure,"Note to entry: A measure ""d"" is positive if d(x, y) > 0 for every x, y where x/=y and d(x,x) = 0. A measure ""d"" is symmetric if d(x, y) = d(y, x) for every x, y. A measure ""d"" satisfies the triangular inequality if d(x, y) <= d(x, a) + d(a, y) for every a, x and y. All numeric or vector valued attributes have such a metric, the most common being the Euclidean metric based on the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in each dimension. Other non-Euclidean metrics take ""curvature of space"" into account (such as along the surface of the spheroid). "
665,distance metric,"Note to entry: A measure ""d"" is positive if d(x, y) > 0 for every x, y where x/=y and d(x,x) = 0. A measure ""d"" is symmetric if d(x, y) = d(y, x) for every x, y. A measure ""d"" satisfies the triangular inequality if d(x, y) <= d(x, a) + d(a, y) for every a, x and y. All numeric or vector valued attributes have such a metric, the most common being the Euclidean metric based on the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in each dimension. Other non-Euclidean metrics take ""curvature of space"" into account (such as along the surface of the spheroid)."
667,identity,"Note to entry: An identity is usually a persistent and constant key member attribute value of the object. Since it is temporally constant and unique, it will be the same in any state associated to the object regardless of its timestamp. A moving object's identity is independent of both time and location."
668,integration,Note to entry: cf. coupling. Integration and coupling are the two major mechanisms for the interoperation of systems.
669,interoperate,Note to entry: cf. interoperability
672,loosely coupled interface,Note to entry: cf. coupling
677,passive object,"Note to entry: A passive object is usually accessed through an external interface, through which it receives requests, processes those requests and returns data as a response to that request. Since objects can implement more than one type, it is possible for a single object to pass through active and passive states. For example, a tracking service can lie dormant until a tracking request activates a period where the internals of the object initiate tracking activities based on internal triggers as specified within the request. When the tracking request is deactivated, the object may return to a passive state."
684,service oriented architecture,"Note to entry: The most common SOAs in use today are Web services (using SOAP, UDDI, and WSDL), CORBA and DCOM."
685,spacestamp,Note to entry: See timestamp.
686,state (of an object),Note to entry: State is usually associated to an object by its identity and to a time by a timestamp.
687,target,"Note to entry: There is little logical difference between traveller and target except that the former is normally used for a moving object which is being tracked, and the latter is used for either an object that is not moving, or an object for which a location is needed only once. A traveller is the subject of a tracking service; a target is the subject of a locating service. Since this International Standard does not make a distinction between the protocols for these logically similar services, but does need to differentiate between the two concepts, both terms will be used as appropriate to the underlying semantics of the situation. Since all of these terms refer to entities represented by objects within the system, they can be combined with adjectives defined for objects. So, an active target (a target represented by an active object) can be used to represent a moving object, since the act of motion is modifying the target's internal state and is therefore initiating actions."
688,temporal sequence,"Note to entry: Temporal sequences are not assumed to be evenly spaced in time, nor equidistance in space. For discrete change, the default logic is to sample at temporal points of change if possible, so that the timestamp is the first temporal instance where the attributes listed have taken on that combination of values. For sake of space savings, some samples in a sequence only list those values that have changed since the immediately preceding temporal sample. For this reason, a sample should only be considered in the context of its containing sequence. For rigid motions (such as vehicle tracking), only centroid (a point value) and orientation (direction of travel) are needed for a temporal sequence describing location and spatial extent. A motion in combination with an object deformation would require more information."
690,tracking device,"Note 1 to entry: The most common tracking devices are cell phones, GNSS chips, RFID (Radio Frequency ID) tags, or printed tags which are scanable by optical sensors such as ""bar codes""."
690,tracking device,"Note 2 to entry: The common usage of ""vehicle"" means a ""form of conveyance"" or, more simply ""thing that conveys (carries) something else"". Thus, a tracked object that carries a tracking device to allow it to be tracked is, by definition, a conveyance or vehicle for that device. Thus, a cell phone that carries a GNSS device is the vehicle for that device, and the traveller carrying the cell phone, allowing him to be tracked, is the vehicle for the phone and all of its internal electronics."
691,user,Note to entry: Users are usually objects that act as proxies for people accessing the functionality of the system.
697,schema document (XML Schema),"Note to entry: The W3C XML Schema provides an XML interchange format for schema information.

746,version (temporal),Note to entry: Temporal versions differ from samples in that a complete description is required. In this sense a version is a complete sample able to be considered outside the domain of the temporal sequence to which it may belong.
756,graph,"Note to entry: In geographic information systems, a graph can have more than one edge joining two nodes, and can have an edge that has the same node at both ends."
762,coordinate conversion,Note to entry: A coordinate conversion uses parameters which have specified values that are not determined empirically.
763,coordinate transformation,Note to entry: A coordinate transformation uses parameters which are derived empirically by a set of points with known coordinates in both coordinate reference systems.

918,matrix,Note to entry: A matrix is a mathematical term
925,aperture reference point,Note to entry: It is usually expressed in ECEF coordinates in metres.
927,azimuth resolution (SAR),"Note to entry: This is usually measured in terms of the impulse response of the SAR sensor and processing system. It is a function of the size of the synthetic aperture, or alternatively the dwell time (i.e. a larger aperture results in a longer dwell time results in better resolution)."
928,beam width (SAR),Note to entry: Beam width is usually measured in radians and as the angular width between two points that have 50% of the power (3 dB below) of the centre of the beam. It is a property of the antenna. Power emitted outside of this angle is too little to provide a usable return.
947,ground range (SAR),"Note to entry: Ground range of an image is represented by the distance from the nadir point of the antenna to a point in the scene. Usually measured in the horizontal plane, but can also be measured as true distance along the ground, DEM, geoid or ellipsoid surface."
952,image-identifiable ground control point,"Note to entry: The ground control point may be marked in the image, or the user may be provided with an unambiguous description of the ground control point so that it can be found in the image."
955,layover,"Note to entry: The effect makes buildings “lay over” onto the ground toward the sensor velocity vector, akin to perspective views in projective imagery."
968,scan mode,Note to entry: Steering the antenna also allows dwell time to be increased and provides the ability to collect strips at angles non-parallel to the flight direction and with better resolution than Stripmap mode.
974,spotlight mode (SAR),Note to entry: Spotlight mode provides the ability to collect higher resolution SAR data over relatively smaller patches of ground surface.
991,Doppler shift,"Note to entry: In the SAR context, it is the frequency shift imposed on a radar signal due to relative motion between the transmitter and the object being illuminated."
994,fiducial mark,Note to entry: When a camera is calibrated the distances between fiducial marks are precisely measured and assigned coordinates that assist in correcting for film distortion.
996,geopositioning,"Note to entry: While there are many methods for geopositioning, this Technical Specification is focused on geopositioning from image coordinates"
999,ground reference point,Note to entry: It is usually the centre point of an image (Spotlight) or an image line (Stripmap). It is usually expressed in ECEF coordinates in metres
1000,ground sampling distance,Note to entry: This definition also applies for water surfaces.
1010,range resolution,"Note to entry: For a SAR sensor, it is usually measured in terms of the impulse response of the sensor and processing system. It is a function of the bandwidth of the pulse."
1028,land use,"Note to entry: The definition of land use in this way establishes a direct link between land cover and the actions of people in their environment. Multiple land uses can coexist at the same location (e.g. forestry and recreation), contrary to land cover classes that are mutually exclusive."
1029,literal value,Note to entry: This contrasts with a value that is determined by resolving a chain of substitution (e.g. a variable)
1042,response model,Note to entry: This is the schema of feature types that a client can obtain using the DescribeFeatureType operation (see Clause 9).
1063,domain feature,"Note to entry: This may be contrasted with observations and sampling features, which are features of types defined for cross-domain purposes."

1118,data compression,Note 1 to entry: Adapted from ANSI T1.523-2001.
1118,data compression,"Note 2 to entry: Data compression is probabilistic in nature based on particular instances of imagery, gridded or coverage data and is related to encoding and is outside the scope of this Technical Specification."
1122,gimbal,Note to entry: An object mounted on a three-ring gimbal will remain horizontally suspended on a plane between the rings regardless as to the stability of the base.
1123,gyroscope,"Note to entry: The rotor spins on a fixed axis while the structure around it rotates or tilts. In airplanes, the pitch and orientation of the airplane is measured against the steady spin of the gyroscope. In space, where the four compass points are meaningless, the gyroscope's axis of rotation is used as a reference point for navigation. An inertial navigation system includes three gimbal-mounted gyroscopes, used to measure roll, pitch, and yaw."
1124,Synthetic Aperture Radar,Note to entry: The electromagnetic radiation is at microwave frequencies and is sent in pulses.
1125,stripmap mode (SAR),Note to entry: Doppler angle in processed products is fixed for all pixels. It provides the ability to collect SAR data over strips of land over a fixed swath of ground range parallel to the direction of flight.

1178,spatial position,Note to entry: An alternative to specifying a location as a linearly referenced location.
1211,authorization,"Note to entry: Usually, authorization is in the context of authentication. Once a subject is authenticated, it can be authorized to perform different types of access."
1212,bypass,"Note to entry: Security systems are bypassed usually by using security faults in the operating system. Such infringements are more an aspect of the operating system than of the security system. To correct this, the relationship between the security system and the operating system shall be modified to prevent bypass mechanisms."
1213,chain of agency,"Note to entry: A chain of agency, with the proper agreements at each step creates a transitive agency between the agent of the first link and the principal of the last. This chain can be spoken of in either direction, either as “principal -> agent = principal -> agent” (normal or granting order) or “agent -> principal = agent -> principal” (reverse, acceptance, verification or tracing order)."
1214,chain of licence,"Note to entry: As with the chain of agency, this chain can be spoken of in either direction."
1216,copyleft,Note to entry: A copyleft is a form of general public licence.
1217,digital licence,"Note to entry: The core concept in DRM is the use of digital licences. Instead of buying the digital content, the consumer purchases a licence granting certain rights with respect to the content. A licence is the mechanism by which a rights holder conveys rights to another party, such as a consumer or distributor."
1218,digital rights management,"Note to entry: DRM covers a much broader spectrum of capabilities and underlying technologies supporting description, identification, trading, protecting, monitoring, and tracking of all forms of rights usages for both tangible and intangible (electronic) assets, including the management of rights-holders relationships. See, for example, Reference [5][of ISO 19153:2014 - Iannella R. Digital Rights Management (DRM) Architectures. D-Lib. 2001 June, 7 (6) Available at: http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june01/iannella/06iannella.html]. “Digital” refers to the material over which the rights exist. “Rights” applies to the Intellectual Property rights linked to the material. “Management” covers both the defining of policy and enforcing that policy in such a way that rights are respected. The ultimate goal of a distributed DRM system is for content authors to be able to project policies governing their content into remote environments with confidence that those policies will be respected by the remote nodes. For the purposes of this International Standard, DRM is taken to mean technology that enables the secure distribution (and where appropriate, sale) of digital media content on the Internet."
1219,expected risk,"Note to entry: Expected risk is calculated by multiplying the probability of the types of infringement by the cost of that infringement, summed up over all types of infringement."
1220,fair use,Note to entry: Fair use is based on case-law precedents derived from general principles. The term is often misapplied to refer to the reasonable expectations of consumers to be able to use purchased content on all owned devices.
1221,general public licence,"Note 1 to entry: GPLs can be granted by the owner of a resource or can be applied to a resource by law, usually as part of the copyright law. The most obvious GPL concept is fair use in the United States for copyrighted material. Other GPL rights can be demanded by the source of the resource or other “public good” considerations."
1221,general public licence,"Note 2 to entry: The most widespread use of GPL is in reference to the GNU GPL, which is commonly abbreviated simply as GPL when it is understood that the term refers to the GNU GPL. One of the basic tenets of the GPL is that anyone who acquires the material shall make it available to anyone else under the same licensing agreement. The GPL does not cover activities other than the copying, distributing, and modifying of the source code. A GPL is also referred to as a copyleft, in contrast to a copyright, which identifies the proprietary rights of material."
1222,GeoDRM enabled,Note to entry: Applied to processing resources.
1227,infringement (of a licence),"Note to entry: Infringement of a licence will require the DRM system to be bypassed in some manner. If licences can be infringed without bypassing the DRM system, then the system is not sufficient."
1228,infringement (of a right),"Note to entry: Infringement of a right is a fault in the DRM system. If rights can be infringed without bypassing the DRM system, then the system is not properly restricted to that which is necessary."
1229,joint ownership,"Note to entry: In this case, the principal as owner is a principal group, i.e. a group of other principals."
1230,lease,"Note to entry: During this period, the resource is only available to the lessee. Temporal constraints are required for downstream use."
1232,licence,"Note to entry: A licence represents, but is not, a contract that grants a party explicit rights to use Intellectual Property."
1233,licence extents,"Note to entry: The extent can be described in spatial, temporal. or any other parameter range appropriate to the rights described in the licence."
1237,licensor,Note to entry: The licensor is a content owner or a licensing agent.
1240,necessary,Note to entry: All aspects of a DRM system are necessary if they do not prevent legitimate requests from execution.
1242,party,"Note 1 to entry: In order to be registered as a party, not all members need to be identified and registered individually."
1242,party,Note 2 to entry: A basic administrative unit may be a party because it may hold a right of e.g. easement.
1243,payment provider,"Note to entry: Payment providers can be telephone and cellular companies, banks, credit card corporations, ISPs, network operators, and utility companies. The payment provider bills the consumer, deducts a fee, and forwards the payment to the content provider. The payment provider is thus responsible for the balancing of accounts."
1244,persistent protection mechanism,"Note to entry: Persistent protection mechanisms involve authentication, authorization, and encryption technologies for effectively locking digital contents and limiting distribution to those who pay."
1245,principal,"Note to entry: These two terms [principal and party] are used as near synonyms from ORDL and ISO 21010. There will be no distinction between these two terms made here, but there can be distinctions in legal documents depending on local laws."
1248,resource (GeoDRM),"Note to entry: In general, a resource is data, metadata (a type of data describing other resources), or some service or process that can be invoked on other resources. Licences describe rights on resources and, as such, are resources in themselves."
1249,remediation,Note to entry: Remediation allows more trust because it lowers expected risk. The first act in a remediation sequence is detection of the fault.
1250,right (GeoDRM),Note to entry: A right specifies an action (or activity) or a class of actions that a principal can perform on or using the associated resource. A right is essentially a legally recognized entitlement to do something to or with the content of a resource.
1251,rights holder,"Note to entry: Rights can be by law (copyright), by agreement, or by contract [the licence agreement]. In the case of digital commerce, DRM ensures that licences are adhered to, and that rights holders are compensated as appropriate for each transaction. Agents of the original rights holder can also issue licences, but their ability is only under the agency contract to the original principal."
1254,sublicence,Note to entry: This is essentially the right to loan one's licence to another principal.
1256,sufficient,"Note to entry: A sufficient DRM system would have to be bypassed if an infringement would be possible. Proof of sufficiency can be difficult because it can be dependent on an ""attack model"", which describes the sorts of attacks to which the system is immune."
1258,trust,"Note to entry: Trust allows the owner [or his agent] to act with a higher potential risk because the expected risk has been lowered. This is slightly different from the plain language of trust. Normally, trust requires something, but if the principal at risk decides that no risk exists, then trust exists (in the sense here) because risk has been reduced, whatever the reason."
1269,portrayal function,Note to entry: Portrayal functions can also include parameters and other computations that are not dependent on geographic feature properties.
1278,error propagation,Note to entry: Error propagation is governed by the mathematical function relating the derived quantity to the quantities from which it was derived.
1289,boundary face string,"Note to entry: Boundary face strings are used to represent the boundaries of spatial units by means of line strings in 2D. This 2D representation is a 2D boundary in a 2D land administration system. In a 3D land administration system it represents a series of vertical boundary faces where an unbounded volume is assumed, surrounded by boundary faces which intersect the Earth’s surface (such as traditionally depicted in the cadastral map)."
1290,building unit,Note to entry: A building unit may be used for different purposes (e.g. living or commercial) or it can be under construction.

1330,customer,Note to entry: The customer can be internal or external to the supplier organisation.
1331,process,Note to entry: The process may be broken down further into elemental activities [sub process]as is deemed necessary to control the quality of the process.
1332,supplier,Note 1 to entry: The supplier can be internal or external to the customer organization.
1332,supplier,"Note 2 to entry: In the context of this Technical Specification, the supplier has provided a product via a process that can have some impact on quality."
1333,join tuple,"Note to entry: In this International Standard, the object instances will be feature instances."
1334,local resource,"Note to entry: In this International Standard, the system is a web feature service and the resource is held in a data store that is directly controlled by that service."
1335,locator attribute,"Note to entry: In XML, this attribute is commonly called an href and contains a URI reference to the remote resource (see W3C XLink)"
1337,Place Identifier,Note to entry: The same place may be referenced by multiple Place Identifier instances. Each instance will be associated with a different reference system.
1339,Place Identifier matching,Note 1 to entry: A source PI can be matched with multiple target Place Identifiers.
1339,Place Identifier matching,"Note 2 to entry: PI matching can be made among coordinates, geographic identifiers and identifiers in the virtual world such as URI."
1341,remote resource,"Note to entry: In this International Standard, the system is a web feature service. The resource is not held in any data store that is directly controlled by that service and thus cannot be directly retreived by the service."
1342,resolve,Note to entry: The insertion may be accomplished by either replacing the reference inline with a copy of the resource or by relocating the reference to point to a copy of the resource that has been placed in the response document.

A barycentric coordinate which has (n+1)-offsets, but the underlying space is dimension n. Homogeneous coordinates (wx, wy, wz, w) are actually 3 dimensional because the choice of ""w"" does not affect the position, i.e. (wx, wy, wz, w) = (x y, z, 1) → (x, y, z) which is not affected by w. The dimension will be at most the count of the numbers in the coordinate, but it can be less if the coordinates are constrained in some manner.asie"
2041,curvature vector (differential geometry),"Note to entry: If c(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s)) is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space (bbb""E""^3), and is the arc length along c(s), then the unit tangent vector is dot c(s) = (dot x(s), dot y(s), dot z(s)), i.e. the derivative of the coordinate values of c with respect to s. The curvature vector is ddot c(s) = (ddot x(s), ddot y(s), ddot z(s)). The curvature vector can be approximated by the inverse of the radius of a circle through any 3 nearby points on the curve (pointed from the curve to towards the centre of the circle) "
2042,"cycle (geometry, topology)","Note to entry: Cycles are used to describe boundary components. A cycle usually has no boundary because it closes on itself, but it is bounded (i.e., it does not have infinite extent). A circle or a sphere, for example, has no boundary (i.e., its boundary is empty), but is bounded."
2046,"distance (geometry, metric spaces)","Note to entry: The usual distance function for two points in a coordinate space assumes an underlying plane and is a Euclidean distance. If the underlying Reference Surface is not a plane, then distance is defined by this minimum length of all curves between the two points. These surfaces are prime examples of non-Euclidean geometry, where the parallel postulate in Euclid's Elements does not hold. In mathematical terms, distance is the ""greatest lower bound"" of the length of the curves. The word minimum is sometimes used, but there should be no expectation that an instance of that minimum actually occurs, only that any larger number will have a length in the set that is smaller."
2050,error budget (metric),"Note to entry: In the most usual case, error budgets in this document describe metric calculations using representational geometry objects to estimate real-world metrics, such as distance and area."
2051,exponential map (differential geometry),Note to entry: See first geodetic problem for an explanation of the process of calculating this mapping.
2055,"geodesic (differential geometry, geodesy)","Note to entry: A geodesic's curvature vector is perpendicular the surface thus has the minimum curvature of any curve restricted to the surface. This is often defined as a minimal distance curve between two points, but this does not always suffice, since some points (especially on ellipsoids and spheres) are often joined by more than one geodesic. For example, on an ellipsoid the points with (φ, λ) = (0, 0) and (0, 180) are joined by four separate geodesic [2 polar (the shorter) and 2 equatorial]. The exponential map is only guaranteed to be one-to-one for a small area (depending on where the centre is and how the surface is curved). "
2056,"geodesic line (differential geometry, geodesy)","Note to entry: A geodesic's curvature vector is perpendicular the surface thus has the minimum curvature of any curve restricted to the surface. This is often defined as a minimal distance curve between two points, but this does not always suffice, since some points (especially on ellipsoids and spheres) are often joined by more than one geodesic. For example, on an ellipsoid the points with (φ, λ) = (0, 0) and (0, 180) are joined by four separate geodesic [2 polar (the shorter) and 2 equatorial]. The exponential map is only guaranteed to be one-to-one for a small area (depending on where the centre is and how the surface is curved)."
2065,inner product (vector geometry),"Note to entry: Inner products in differential geometry are used on the differentials that make up the local tangent spaces. In this document, this will usually be vectors tangent to a datum surface embedded a geocentric <<math>> Euclidean/Cartesian space."
2070,maximum (mathematics),"([\forall a \in A \implies max(A) \geq a] \implies [\forall b \ni [(b \ni [\forall a \in A \implies b \geq a] \implies [max(a) \leq b]] )Any number is an upper bound of O/ (empty set) as a set of numbers, because any given number is greater than any number in O/ (an admitted vacuous statement since there is no number in , but true nonetheless). This means that the max(O/) must be smaller than any number; thus -oo."
2071,least upper bound (mathematics),"[\forall a \in A \implies max(A) \geq a] \implies [\forall b \ni [(b \ni [\forall a \in A \implies b \geq a] \implies [max(a) \leq b]] Any number is an upper bound of O/ (empty set) as a set of numbers, because any given number is greater than any number in O/ (an admitted vacuous statement since there is no number in O/, but true nonetheless).

2072,minimum (mathematics),"[\forall a \in A \implies min(A) \leq a] \implies [\forall b \ni [(b \ni [\forall a \in A \implies b \leq a] \implies [min(A) \geq b]] Any number is a lower bound of O/ considered as a set of numbers, because any given number is less than any number in O/ (an admitted vacuous statement since there is no number in O/, but true nonetheless). This means that the min(O/) must be greater than any number; this +oo."
2075,"n-simplex (geometry, topology)","Note to entry: An n-simplex is n-dimensional, and is topological isomorphic to an n-disc. A 0-simplex is a point. A 1-simplex is a curve (usually a line) with two 0-simplexes (points) on its boundary; a 2-simplex is a triangular surface with three 1-simplices on its boundary. In general, an n-simplex boundary will have n (n−1)-simplexes. An n-simplex and an n-disc are topologically isomorphic. The boundary of an n-simplex is isomorphic to an (n−1)-sphere. In all cases, the number prefix represents the topological dimension of the object."
2078,"normal section curve (differential geometry, geodesy)","Note to entry: The usual construction begins by choosing one of the end points, the normal to the surface at that end point, and the location of the other end point and creating a plane in 𝔼3, which is then intersected with the datum. This curve is a normal section curve between these two points, containing the normal to the surface at the first point. On the sphere, this is the geodesic, and the two normal section curves are equal. On an ellipsoidal datum, the same is true for two points on the equator, or two points on the same meridian plane, but false in general. The reason is that in these cases the plane through the two points and the centre of the ellipsoid are planes of symmetry for the ellipsoid dividing the ellipsoid into symmetric ""mirror"" image halves. In general, the geodesic between the two points lies between the two normal section curves."
2081,Pythagorean metric (Euclidean geometry),"P = (p_i), Q = (q_i), ""distance""(P,Q) = sqrt( sum_{i=1}^n (p_i - q_i)^2) The proofs of the Pythagorean metrics all depend on the local ""flatness"" of the space. Cartesian coordinate space which have Pythagorean metrics are called Euclidean spaces (bbb""E""^n). In the realm of coordinate reference systems, only ""Engineering Coordinate Systems"" are Euclidean. Any CRS using a curved Datum are by definition non-Euclidean, and cannot ""truthfully"" use Pythagorean metrics except for approximation. These approximations are valid for topological statements, but not for real world measures without adjustments. "
2091,"tangent (differential geometry, calculus)","Note to entry: The tangent is usually calculated by differentiation of a functional representation of a curve but it may be approximated by a secant (double intersection) line from the point passing through another nearby point on the curve. The closer the second point is to the first, the better the approximation of the tangent's direction."
2095,tangent vector,"Note to entry: If c(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s)) is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space (bbb""E""^3), and is arc length along c, then the tangent is vec tau(s) = dot c(s) = (dot x(s), dot y(s), dot z(s)), i.e. the derivative of the coordinate values of c with respect to s. The curvature vector is kappa(s) = ddot c(s) = (ddot x(s), ddot y(s, ddot z(s)). "
2096,"topological boundary (geometry, topology)",Note to entry: The boundary of a topological complex is the boundary of the geometric realization of the topological complex.
2100,looks,Note to entry: The resulting image formed by incoherent summing of these looks is characterized by reduced speckle and degraded spatial resolution.
2101,thematic data,Note to entry: Most gridded thematic data are derived from imagery (4.12) data using geophysical/atmospheric inversion algorithms. Gridded thematic data may also be obtained from other sources such as digitization of topographic map sheets.
2104,transfer node,"Note 1 to entry: A transfer node may contain other transfer nodes and may be related to one or more transport modes and transport networks. It may also contain stop points and facilities for the users of the transfer node. A transfer node may host services that are provided to the users of the transfer node, e.g. information services, ticket sales, etc."
2104,transfer node,"Note 2 to entry: A transfer node may be a part of a hierarchy of transfer nodes. Thus, a transfer node may be related to many transport modes and transport networks. However, only transfer nodes that are related to just one transport network will have stop points."
2104,transfer node,"Note 3 to entry: The stop points related to different transfer nodes, which may serve different transport modes and networks, may, in real life, have the same physical locations. A tram and a bus may for example share the same platform, but conceptually they may belong to different transfer nodes."
2106,transport mode,"Note to entry: In this International Standard, the term ”transport mode” is frequently shortened to “mode” for convenience. Transport mode is usually covering groups of vehicles, e.g. transport means used for road transport, rail transport, sea transport, air transport and cable transport. A mode for inland water-borne transport is also added."
2107,trip pattern,Note to entry: Defines a path to be followed by a transport service; also called route.
2112,addressee,"Note 1 to entry: The addressee may be explicitly defined as part of the postal address, or may be implicit. For example, in certain countries, omission of addressee information is taken as implying that delivery is to be to an individual or legal entity having legal access to the delivery point."
2112,addressee,"Note 2 to entry: Mr. or Mrs. Smith specifies that the addressee is either of two individuals, while Mr. Jones and Mrs. Smith denote that the addressee is a group of two individuals. See also role descriptor."
2112,addressee,"Note 3 to entry: The use made by the postal operator of addressee and mailee data might be dependent on the postal service applicable to the postal item. For some services, such as registered mail, the postal operator’s responsibility might include ensuring that the addressee or a duly authorized representative acknowledges receipt of the postal item. In other cases, addressee data could be purely informative or used by the postal operator only for consistency checking and/or for the activation of forwarding services. In other cases, it might be used for sorting or sequencing purposes prior to delivery, e.g. in the case of business mail being pre-sequenced by department or individual company official."
2112,addressee,"Note 4 to entry: In some countries, the addressee may be an abstraction such as “postal customer”."
2113,delivery address (postal),"Note 1 to entry: In the normal case, the delivery address is the same as the postal address specified by the mailer."
2113,delivery address (postal),"Note 2 to entry: The delivery address may in certain circumstances, e.g. unaddressed mail, not actually be represented on the postal item. In this case, the delivery address is determined by the postal operator in accordance with an agreement between the operator and the mailer."
2113,delivery address (postal),"Note 3 to entry: The postal item might not actually be delivered to the requested delivery address. For example, in the case of forwarding, delivery takes place at the forwarding address."
2116,mailee,"Note 1 to entry: Unlike the addressee, the mailee is always specified explicitly in a postal address, i.e. if a postal address does not contain a mailee, then there is no mailee."
2116,mailee,"Note 2 to entry: Notwithstanding Note 1 to entry, the mailee may be designated explicitly by use of a role descriptor or designated implicitly with no role descriptor."
2116,mailee,"Note 3 to entry: As is the case for addressee, a mailee specified in a postal address might be ambiguous."

2143,U-code,Note to entry: The postal address element code conforms to conventions specified in 7.2 and is relatively language independent when compared with the element and sub-element names.
2144,internal accuracy,"Note to entry: Relative accuracy may also be referred to as point-to-point accuracy. The general measure of relative accuracy is an evaluation of the random errors (systematic errors and blunders removed) in determining the positional orientation (for example, distance and azimuth) of one point or feature with respect to another. In lidar, this also may specifically mean the accuracy between adjacent swaths within a lift, adjacent lifts within a project, or between adjacent projects. "
2151,"conformal, adj.","Note to entry: Some projections are conformal. For example, a Mercator preserves the angle between curves, so that if two curves in a Mercator projected plane cross at a 90°, then the preimage curves on the ellipsoid also cross at 90°, such as lines of constant latitude and lines of constant longitude."
2152,connected,"Note to entry: The formal definition of connected is that any pair of locally open sets whose union is the entire space must have a non-empty intersection. \text{a topological space T is connected if and only if } [\forall X,Y \subset T \backepsilon X \cup Y = T] \implies [X \cap Y \ne \emptyset] This formal definition is difficult to use. The term path connected, defined below is equivalent for the purposed of this document. The use or ""finite precision"" coordinates makes sets which are connected but not path connected impossible to represent. In all cases ""connected"" is used, but ""path connected"" is easier to test and to visualize."
2153,path connected,"Note to entry: There are more general geometries that are connected but not path connected, but they are not representable as collections of ""digital"" geometries defined in this document. No geometric objects constructible by the methods in this document on a standard digital computer can be connected but not path connected. See the notes at the term ""connected"""
2154,control point (coordinate geometry),Note to entry: A centre of an arc is a control point; poles in b-spline curves are control points.
2155,data point (coordinate geometry),"Note to entry: The vertices in a line string are data points, the points used to construct a polynomial spline are data points. Data points can be used as control points, but are often derived after the geometry is constructed."
2158,empty set (mathematics),"Note to entry: Sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. Since any two empty sets would share exactly the same contained elements (by definition none), they are, by definition, equal. The empty set (∅) can be considered a geometric entity, because all the elements it contains are points. This is a vacuous statement since the set ∅ contains no elements, and therefore the ""for all"" statement has nothing to test and is thus true in each of its non-existent cases. There are a lot of true but vacuous statements in proofs about ∅. This confuses some programmers since many systems use type safe sets, in which the class of the entities determines a class for the container set. The math does not care about ""class"" and only sees sets; so that an empty set of aardvarks and an empty set of zebras in mathematics are (is?) the same set. The other confusion is that ∅ is not the database Null introduced by Codd and used in relational and other query languages in 3 valued logic. Null means unknown and many statements involving Null are undecidable (neither provably true nor provably false). The empty set is not ""lack of knowledge"" but certainty in the nonexistence of elements in the set. Most statements beginning ""for all elements in ∅"" are true, but vacuous. Most statements beginning ""there exist an element in ∅"" are always categorically false. It is almost impossible to construct an undecidable statement about ∅. Null and ∅ are not related. ""Void"" can mean ""invalid"" or ""completely empty."""
2159,"first geodetic problem (differential geometry, geodesy)","Note to entry: This ""problem"" defines a mapping from the vector space at a point (each vector given by a direction and a length) to points of the Figure of Earth that satisfy the problem for that direction and distance. For example, if we fix the distance ""r"" and take all directions, the resultant geometry is the circle centred at the original point of radius ""r"". This document will make heavy use of this mapping; see exponential map and the second geodetic problem."

This document will make heavy use of this mapping; see exponential map and the second geodetic problem. "
2162,"geodesic circle (differential geometry, geodesy)",Note to entry: The geodesic circles centred on a pole (either one) are the lines of constant latitude. Circles in a tangent space centred on the origin (corresponding to the point of tangency) map to geodesic circles by the exponential map on the geometric reference surface centred on the point of tangency.
2163,"geometric dimension (geometry, topology)","Note to entry: Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line, have geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot always be mapped to RR^2 in their entirety, but around each point position, a small neighborhood can be found that resembles (under continuous functions) the interior of the unit circle in RR^2, and are therefore 2-dimensional. In this document, most surfaces (instances of Surface) are mapped to portions of RR^2 by their defining interpolation mechanisms."
2164,geometric primitive (geometry),"Note to entry: Geometric primitives are non-decomposed objects that present information about geometric configuration. They include points, curves, surfaces, and solids. Many geometric objects behave like primitives (supporting the same interfaces defined for geometric primitives) but are actually composites composed of some number of other primitives. General collections may be aggregates and incapable of acting like a primitive (such as the lines of a complex network, which is not connected and thus incapable of being traceable as a single line). By this definition, a geometric primitive is topological open, since the boundary points are not isotropic to the interior points. Geometry is assumed to be closed. For points, the boundary is empty."
2166,geometric set (geometry),"Note to entry: This set in most cases is infinite, except where the set consists of a list of point locations. Curves, surfaces and volumes being continuous are infinite sets of points. Some systems will define 'degenerate' curves, which are actually points."
2168,homomorphism (mathematics),"Note to entry: A homomorphism is distinct from a isomorphism in that no inverse function is required. In an isomorphism, there are two homomorphisms that are functional inverses of one another. Continuous functions are topological homomorphisms because they preserve ""topological characteristics"". The mapping of topological complexes to their geometric realizations preserves the concept of boundary and is therefore a homomorphism."

The cross-talk on receiving is similar to that on transmitting."
2196,polarimetric synthetic aperture radar,"Note to entry: By combining multiple polarization modes, it is possible to characterize the target more clearly. Quad-Pol SAR system both transmits and receives orthogonal (e.g. horizontal and vertical) polarizations, which creates four polarizations of a single imaging scene. The calibration of Quad-Pol SAR is addressed in this document."
2200,radar cross section,Note 1 to entry: Radar cross section is calculated as sigma = lim_(R ->oo) 4 pi R^2 (abs(E_s)^2) / (abs(E_i)^2) where is the radar cross section; E_i is the electric-field strength of the incident wave; E_s is the electric-field strength of the scattered wave at the radar with a distance R away from the target.

This means that the min(O/) must be greater than any number; this +oo."
2238,bearing,"Note to entry: This definition (as opposed to the one in ISO 19162:2015) is required for this document because the concept is used in other definitions, such as first geodetic problem and second geodetic problem. The two definitions are nearly equivalent because the tangent of a curve on a surface is a tangent to the surface and does specify a direction. Usual 2D measure of bearing can be an angle equivalently measured from North clockwise, or a unit tangent vector. If the coordinate system is spatially 3D, the horizontal bearing angle may also need to a vertical altitude angle to be complete. If a reference curve (as used in ISO 19162) is parameterized by arc length, then the ""derivative"" is a unit vector. If another parameterization is used, then the derivative should be normalized (vec tau / (norm (vec tau)); dot c(t) = vec tau;). This is useful, since parameterization by arc length can be computationally difficult. The numeric representation of a vector depends on the coordinate system. The bearing is not dependent on a coordinate system, but it can be represented in any reasonable system. The bearing is not dependent on its various representations."
2239,convex (geometry),"Note to entry: The definition of convex requires a definition of line. For coordinate systems, this is the usual linear interpolated arc, but in context, the ""line"" on a geometric reference surface will be a ""geodesic arc"". The default in this document is the linear interpolate."
2243,"normal curvature vector (differential geometry, geodesy)","Note to entry: The normal curvature vector of a curve is dependent only on the curve and the surface (which is a constraint on the curve). The normal curvature vector of a curve restricted to a surface is parallel to the normal vector of the surface. If the normal curvature vector is equal to the curvature vector of the curve everywhere, then the curve is a geodesic."
2244,"normal (differential geometry, geodesy)","Note to entry: The normal will be parallel to the ""upward"" normal for surfaces in 𝔼3 defined in the surface interface in ISO 19107:2019, 6.4.17.2."
2245,"open set (metric, topology, geometry)","Note to entry: In a metric space, a set X us open if each point x in the set is contained in some small ball which is a subset of X: [X \text{ is open}] \Leftrightarrow [x \in X] \implies [\exists \varepsilon > 0 \backepsilon \text{distance} (x,y) < \varepsilon] \implies [y \in X]. A topology is a set of subsets of a space which are considered open."
2247,plane curve (geometry),"Note to entry: In a 2-dimensional coordinate system, the test for plane curve to be valid is done in the 3-dimensional space of the geometric reference surface or coordinate reference system datum."
2250,"simple (topology, geometry)",Note to entry: The interior is everywhere locally isomorphic to an open disc in a Euclidean coordinate space of the appropriate dimension D^n = {P | norm P < 1.0}. The boundary is a dimension one smaller. This essentially means that the object does not intersect nor touch itself. Generally used for a curve that does not cross not touch itself with the possible exception of boundary points. Simple closed curves are isomorphic to a circle. 
2251,"spatial dimension, adj (topology, geometry)","Note to entry: This definition is logically equivalent to the topological dimension of spatial projection of the CRS. It describes the space as a target for geometry. Grammatically, the term can be a noun but used to describe space, as ""the spatial dimension of CRS84 is 2""."
2252,"spatial dimension, noun (topology, geometry)","Note to entry: ""A Euclidean space with a spatial dimension of 3, 𝔼3, usually uses axis names 'x', 'y', and 'z', Its first spatial dimension is 'x', its second is 'y' and its third is 'z'."" In the context of the space, the adjective use describes the space but the singular noun can use a name for an axis separately."
2254,"topological primitive (geometry, topology)",Note to entry: A topological primitive corresponds to the interior of a geometric primitive of the same dimension in a geometric realization.
2255,type coercion (programming),"Note to entry: Point and DirectPosition are informationally identical (related to each other in a one to one fashion) in this context. Given a DirectPosition, a Point can be constructed. Given a Point, a DirectPosition can be derived from of its coordinates. If coercion is supported, a Point may be used where a DirectPosition is requested, and vice versa. Most programming languages use coercion, but others use ""cast"" operators (a type of constructor) requiring the programmer to initiate the coercion. ""Strong substantiality"" is related in that a subtype instance can always be coerced to any of its supertypes."
2260,cross-map register,"Note to entry: A cross-map register may be realized as a subregister in a hierarchical register. In such cases, the term ""cross-map subregister"" may be used."
2264,access rights information,"Note to entry: Access rights information contains the access and distribution conditions stated within the submission agreement, related to both preservation (by the OAIS) and final usage (by the consumer). It also includes the specifications for the application of rights enforcement measures."

2271,digital migration,Note to entry: Digital migration is distinguished from transfers in general by three attributes: — a focus on the preservation of the full information content that needs preservation; — a perspective that the new archival implementation of the information is a replacement for the old; — an understanding that full control and responsibility over all aspects of the transfer resides with the OAIS.
2272,information package,Note to entry: Associated with this information package is packaging information used to delimit and identify the content information and package description information used to facilitate searches for the content information.
2273,long term,Note to entry: This period extends into the indefinite future.
2274,open archival information system,"Note to entry: An OAIS Archive meets a set of responsibilities that allows to be distinguished from other uses of the term 'archive'. The term 'open' in OAIS is used to imply that this recommendation and future related recommendations and standards are developed in open forums, and it does not imply that access to the archive is unrestricted."
2276,producer (OAIS),Note to entry: This can include other OAISes or internal OAIS persons or systems.
2277,provenance information,"Note to entry: This information tells the origin or source of the content information, any changes that may have taken place since it was originated, and who has had custody of it since it was originated. The archive is responsible for creating and preserving provenance Information from the point of Ingest; however, earlier provenance information should be provided by the producer. Provenance information adds to the evidence to support authenticity."
2278,reference information,Note to entry: Reference information also includes identifiers that allow outside systems to refer unambiguously to particular content information. An example of reference information is an ISBN.

2285,integrated side lobe ratio,"Note 1 to entry: The integrated side lobe ratio (ISLR) can be obtained by integrating the power of the impulse response over suitable regions. The ISLRis expressed as ISLR = 10log_(10) {(P_(text(total))-P_(text(main)))/(P_(text(main)))} where P_(text(total)) is the total power, P_(text(main)) is the main lobe power. "
2285,integrated side lobe ratio,"Note 2 to entry: The main lobe width can be taken as α times the impulse response width (IRW), centred around the peak, where α is a predefined constant, usually between 2 and 2,5."
2286,peak side lobe ratio,Note to entry: The peak side lobe ratio is usually expressed in decibels (dB) and computed as follows PSLR = 10log_(10) {(P_(text(sidepeak)))/(P_(text(mainpeak)))} where P_(text(mainpeak)) is the peak power of the main lobe; P_(text(sidepeak)) is the peak power of the largest side lobe.
2293,implementation coverage,"Note 1 to entry: An implementation coverage is a concrete document in some concrete encoding, such as a GeoTIFF file."

2345,location,Note to entry: A location identifies a geographic place.
2346,backscattering coefficient,"Note 1 to entry: If the radar return from the illuminated area is contributed by a number of independent scattering elements, it is described by the backscattering coefficient instead of radar cross section used for the point target. It is calculated as sigma^0 = sigma/A Where sigma is the total radar cross section of an area A. sigma^0 is a dimesionless parameter and is usually expressed in decibels (dB) as follows: sigma_(dB)^0 = 10 log_(10) sigma^0 "
2346,backscattering coefficient,Note 2 to entry: “Backscattering coefficient” is sometimes called “normalized radar cross section”.

2350,coordinate conversion,Note to entry: A coordinate conversion uses parameters which have specified values. 
2354,coordinate transformation,Note 1 to entry: A coordinate transformation uses parameters which are derived empirically. Any error in those coordinates will be embedded in the coordinate transformation and when the coordinate transformation is applied the embedded errors are transmitted to output coordinates.
2354,coordinate transformation,"Note 2 to entry: A coordinate transformation is colloquially sometimes referred to as a 'datum transformation'. This is erroneous. A coordinate transformation changes coordinate values. It does not change the definition of the datum. In this document coordinates are referenced to a coordinate reference system. A coordinate transformation operates between two coordinate reference systems, not between two datums."
2355,coordinate tuple,Note to entry: The number of coordinates in the coordinate tuple equals the dimension of the coordinate system; the order of coordinates in the coordinate tuple is identical to the order of the axes of the coordinate system.
2358,datum ensemble,Note 1 to entry: Datasets referenced to the different realizations within a datum ensemble may be merged without coordinate transformation.
2358,datum ensemble,Note 2 to entry: 'Approximate' is for users to define and typically is in the order of under 1 decimetre but may be up to 2 metres.

2371,gravity-related height,"Note 2 to entry: The distance from the reference surface may follow a curved line, not necessarily straight, as it is influenced by the direction of gravity."
2372,parameter reference epoch,Note to entry: The transformation parameter values first need to be propagated to the epoch of the coordinates before the coordinate transformation can be applied.
2373,point motion operation,Note 1 to entry: The change of coordinates is from those at an initial epoch to those at another epoch.
2373,point motion operation,Note 2 to entry: In this document the point motion is due to tectonic motion or crustal deformation.

2377,spherical coordinate system,Note to entry: Not to be confused with an ellipsoidal coordinate system based on an ellipsoid 'degenerated' into a sphere.
2379,terrestrial reference system,Note to entry: The abstract concept of a TRS is realised through a terrestrial reference frame that usually consists of a set of physical points with precisely determined coordinates and optionally their rates of change. In this document terrestrial reference frame is included within the geodetic reference frame element of the data model.
2380,transformation reference epoch,Note to entry: Coordinates first need to be propagated to this epoch before the coordinate transformation is applied. This is in contrast to a parameter reference epoch where the transformation parameter values first need to be propagated to the epoch of the coordinates before the coordinate transformation is applied.
2381,vertical reference system,Note to entry: The abstract concept of a VRS is realised through a vertical reference frame.
2382,ellipsoid (geodesy),Note 1 to entry: For the Earth the rotation is about the polar axis. This results in an oblate ellipsoid with midpoint of the foci located at the nominal centre of the Earth.
2382,ellipsoid (geodesy),"Note 2 to entry: The two usual algorithms for latitude on an ellipsoid and on a sphere (such as used in spherical coordinates) are only equivalent if the ellipsoid is a sphere, having all radii equal in all directions. The problem is that a radial line from the centre of a general ellipsoid does not always cross the surface of the ellipsoid orthogonally. In general, planar slices through the centre do not intersect the surface orthogonally, and therefore the curves that correspond to the great circles of a sphere are not geodesics on the ellipsoid."
2382,ellipsoid (geodesy),Note 3 to entry: The topology of the ellipsoid is inherited from the 𝔼3 space in which it is embedded. The difference is that metrics such as distance and direction on the ellipsoid are restricted to curves wholly on the surface and vectors tangent to the surface.
2384,"geometric realization (geometry, topology)","Note to entry: In such a realization, the topological primitives are considered to represent the interiors of the corresponding geometric primitives even though the primitives themselves are closed."

2403,dynamic coordinate reference system,"Note 1 to entry: Coordinates of points on or near the crust of the Earth that are referenced to a dynamic coordinate reference system may change with time, usually due to crustal deformations such as tectonic motion and glacial isostatic adjustment."
2403,dynamic coordinate reference system,Note 2 to entry: Metadata for a dataset referenced to a dynamic coordinate reference system should include coordinate epoch information.
2404,ellipsoid (geodesy),Note to entry: For the Earth the ellipsoid is bi-axial with rotation about the polar axis. This results in an oblate ellipsoid with the midpoint of the foci located at the nominal centre of the Earth.
2405,reference ellipsoid,Note to entry: For the Earth the ellipsoid is bi-axial with rotation about the polar axis. This results in an oblate ellipsoid with the midpoint of the foci located at the nominal centre of the Earth.

2409,height,Note 2 to entry: Generalisation of ellipsoidal height (h) and gravity-related height (H).
2410,static coordinate reference system,Note 1 to entry: Coordinates of points on or near the crust of the Earth that are referenced to a static coordinate reference system do not change with time.
2410,static coordinate reference system,Note 2 to entry: Metadata for a dataset referenced to a static coordinate reference system does not require coordinate epoch information.
2412,dynamic datum,Note to entry: The defining parameters that have time evolution are usually a coordinate set.
2449,external accuracy,"Note to entry: Where the true coordinate value may not be perfectly known, accuracy is normally tested by comparison to available values that can best be accepted as true."
2451,positional reliability,"Note to entry: The wording of the definition has been adopted from ISO/IEC 16350:2015, 4.29."
2455,barycentric coordinates (coordinate geometry),"Note to entry: Even though there are n+1 coordinates in a barycentric coordinate system, the topological dimension is n, since the restriction (sums to 1.0) loses 1 degree of freedom (once you have n ordinates, the remaining one is determined such as u_n = 1.0 − sum_(i=0)^(n-1) u_i. he coordinates for the simplex are all non-negative, but the system can be extended outside of the simples by using negative numbers. If the ordinates are all positive, then the point is inside (interior to) the n-simplex. If one of them is 1.0 and the other 0, this is a corner of the simplex. If one of them is zero and the others still each greater than or equal to zero, the point is on the n-1-simplex opposite the vertex zeroed out. If any are negative, the point is outside of the simplex. The coordinates are dependent on the underlying coordinate reference system of the source data."
2467,geopositioning,"Note to entry: While there are many methods for geopositioning, this document is focused on geopositioning from image coordinates."
2490,terrestrial reference frame,"Note 1 to entry: The realization is achieved through a set of physical points with precisely determined coordinates in a specific coordinate system, which may include the rate of coordinate change."
2490,terrestrial reference frame,"Note 2 to entry: The realization is called static when no rates of coordinate change are defined, and kinematic when rates of coordinate change are defined without considering the underlying forces causing the motion. The realization may be called dynamic when these external forces are considered. ""Dynamic"" is also used colloquially to describe both the dynamic and kinematic cases without distinction."
