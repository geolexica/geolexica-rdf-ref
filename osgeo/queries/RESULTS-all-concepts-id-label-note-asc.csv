Z39.50 protocol,Note to entry:  Z39.50 is defined in ANSI/NISO Z39.50 and ISO 23950. The standard is maintained by the US Library of Congress.
compression,"Note to entry: The technique reduces the space used by data by reducing the amount of bits needed to store and transmit information. Alternatively, there are techniques for lossless or destructive compressions."
coordinate,"Note to entry:  In a spatial coordinate reference system, the coordinate numbers are qualified by units."
coordinate reference system,Note 1 to entry:  Geodetic and vertical datums are referred to as reference frames.
coordinate reference system,"Note 2 to entry:  For geodetic and vertical reference frames, the object will be the Earth. In planetary applications, geodetic and vertical reference frames may be applied to other celestial bodies."
coverage,"Note to entry:  In other words, a coverage is a feature that has multiple values for each attribute type, where each direct position within the geometric representation of the feature has a single value for each attribute type."
data compression,Note to entry:  Adapted from ANSI T1.523-2001.
database,Note to entry:  There are different types of databases.
database management system,"Note to entry:  DBMSes may use any of a variety of database models, such as the network model or relational model. In large systems, a DBMS allows users and other software to store and retrieve data in a structured way."
dataset,"Note to entry:  A dataset can be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited by some constraint such as spatial extent or feature type, is located physically within a larger dataset. Theoretically, a dataset can be as small as a single feature or feature attribute contained within a larger dataset. A hardcopy map or chart can be considered a dataset.;"

ellipsoid,Note to entry:  For the Earth the ellipsoid is bi-axial with rotation about the polar axis. This results in an oblate ellipsoid with the midpoint of the foci located at the nominal centre of the Earth.
geopositioning,"Note to entry: While there are many methods for geopositioning, this document is focused on geopositioning from image coordinates."
geospatial data set,Note to entry: Geospatial datasets are typically the main elements in a GIS data model.
geospatial metadata instance,Note to entry: There is typically a metadata instance for each geospatial dataset in a GIS.

metadata element,Note 1 to entry:  Metadata elements are unique within a metadata class.
metadata element,Note 2 to entry:  Equivalent to an attribute and/or an association in UML terminology.
metadata element,Note 3 to entry:  Class attributes and relationships are referred to collectively as metadata elements.
metadata entity,Note 1 to entry:  Can contain one or more metadata entities.
metadata entity,Note 2 to entry:  Equivalent to a class in UML terminology.
mosaic,Note to entry:  See also: imagemosaic
nomenclator service,"Note to entry:  If one or more occurrences of a location are detected, the service provides a list of the detected locations with additional attributes. The user can then choose the desired location as per their requirement."
raster,Note 1 to entry:  A raster is a type of grid.
raster,Note 2 to entry:  The term “raster data” is often used colloquially in the field of geographic information to identify the whole class of data where the spatial geometry is organized into a grid.
raster layer,Note 1 to entry:  Each cell has a distinct value and all the cells sharing the same value represent a specific feature.
raster layer,Note 2 to entry:  Raster layers are analogous to coverages.
spindle,"Note to entry:  In the UTM projection, each spindle is defined by two meridians separated by a distance of 6 degrees (for a total circle round of 360 degrees) and by two parallels of 80 degrees latitude North and South."
tileindex,Note to entry:  A tilelindex is normally in the form of a shpfile
